# ODB Redo Analyzer

A web application to monitor and analyze the redo logs generated by Oracle-compatible database sessions 

## Features

- Real-time monitoring of redo logs generated by each database session.
- Export report data to CSV format for offline analysis.
- Clean web interface developed using Spring Boot.
- No database installation required — the application uses official views to retrieve the data

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Git
- Java 8
- Maven

### Running the App

1.  Open your terminal or command prompt.

2.  Clone the repository using Git:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/xabierbahillo1/odb-redo-analyzer.git
    ```

3.  Navigate to the cloned repository's root directory:

    ```bash
    cd odb-redo-analyzer
    ```

4.  Run the following Maven command to build and start the service:

    ```bash
    mvn spring-boot:run
    ```

The application should now be running on `localhost:3000`.

## Database Configuration

This application allows you to configure the Oracle-compatible database connection directly from the web interface.

Access the configuration form at: [http://localhost:3000/config](http://localhost:3000/config)

On this page, you can enter the database credentials including:

- Oracle-compatible DB URL (e.g., `jdbc:oracle:thin:@localhost:1521:xe`)
- Username
- Password
- Role

**Important:** The database user must have **SELECT** permissions on the following views; otherwise, the application will not be able to retrieve the necessary data for reports, and it will result in the following error: ORA-00942: table or view does not exist

- `V$SESSION`
- `V$SESSTAT`
- `V$STATNAME`
- `V$ARCHIVED_LOG`
- `V$DATABASE`

The page also displays the current connection status:

- **Not Configured** — no credentials have been set yet.
- **Connected** — connection to the database is successful.
- **Error** — there was a problem connecting; hover the cursor over the status to see detailed error information in a tooltip.

**Note:** It may take up to one minute for the connection status to update after changing the configuration.

Once the credentials are saved, the application will use them to connect and monitor the database redo logs.

## Viewing Reports

Once the application is running and connected to the database, access the root URL:

[http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)

You will see a daily summary table with the following columns:

|           | Date       | Archivelogs Size     | Calculated Redo Size   |
|-----------|------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|
| *Button*  | The day    | Archivelogs size reported by the database | Redo size calculated by the application |

- The **Archivelogs Size** is only calculated if the Oracle database is running in ARCHIVELOG mode.
- Both **Redo Size** columns will show **N/A** until the full day has elapsed.

To view detailed session data for a specific day, click the **View** button. This opens a session-level report with the following columns:

| SID | Serial | Logon Time | Username | Program | Redo Size | Last Updated |
|-----|--------|------------|----------|---------|-----------|--------------|
